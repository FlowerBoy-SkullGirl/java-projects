Thread method setName() can set a thread's name

Thread is a class, and it's constructor can be used with a Runnable implementation and the start() method to start a Thread

Thread.currentThread.getName(); returns a string

the keyword synchronized can be used to ensure that only one thread can access it at a time

eg

private synchronized void makeWithdrawal(int amount){}

all objects synchronized methods are blocked when any other synchronized method is running

synchronized(this){
	statements
	statements
}
