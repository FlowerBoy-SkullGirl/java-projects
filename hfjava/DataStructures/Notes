WILDCARDS
	For polymorphic data structures
		eg.
		public void func(ArrayList<? extends Animal> animals);

	Wildcards prevent using add() to the Collection that is passed in, therefore avoiding compile time issues where this would be allowed

	Can also use a "template" generic type
	public <T extends Animal> void func(ArrayList<T> a);
